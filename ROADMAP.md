# MTG Commander Tracker — Project Roadmap

> Build order following a UI-first approach. Each phase builds on what's already stable before moving to the next layer. **Complete Phase 3 before touching Supabase** — the mock phase is where the schema gets battle-tested before it costs you a migration.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation
> Complete!

- [x] TypeScript types for all data models (`/types`)
- [x] `RATING_CONFIG` constant and rating algorithm as pure functions (`/lib/rating`)

---

## Phase 2 — UI Shell
> Complete!

- [x] Global layout (nav, sidebar, auth-aware shell)

## Phase 4 — Supabase Setup
> Complete!

  - [x] `001_initial_schema.sql` — Core tables (profiles, friends, decks, formats, matches, match_participants, collections, collection_members, collection_matches, ratings, rating_history)
  - [x] `002_schema_additions.sql` — Notifications system with fan-out on write, TTL cleanup, Realtime subscription
- [x] Row Level Security policies for every table

  - [x] `types/database-mappers.ts` — snake_case → camelCase conversion
  - [x] `types/notification.ts` — Notification type definitions
  - [x] Updated `types/index.ts` exports

  - [x] Collections page
  - [x] Player profile page
